# Shubham Beladiya — Portfolio

This repository contains a simple, responsive personal portfolio website.

Files added/updated:

- `index.html` — Home / hero / about preview and links to projects and contact.
- `Contact.html` — Contact page with a simple form (uses mailto fallback).
- `projects.html` — Projects overview page (placeholders to replace with real work).
- `about.html` — Longer bio / experience page.
- `style.css` — Modern responsive styling.
- `scripts.js` — Mobile nav toggle, footer year, and contact mailto behavior.
- `photos/` — existing images used as thumbnails/logo/background.

How to run locally

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use a local file server).

Optional: serve with a lightweight server for better behavior (recommended for development):

On Windows PowerShell, from project folder run:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Next steps

- Replace placeholder project images and descriptions in `projects.html`.
- Add a hosted resume `resume.pdf` and update the resume link.
- Hook the contact form to a backend or Formspree for production submissions.
